- This project is based on the [[https://github.com/nbigaouette/onnxruntime-rs][nbigaouette github repository]], which is a wrapper of onnxruntime of C/C++ package. So onnxruntime dependencies has to be installed at first.

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports none
  export C_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/home/si/Desktop/onnxruntime/onnxruntime18training/include
  export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$C_INCLUDE_PATH:/home/si/Desktop/onnxruntime/onnxruntime18training/include
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/si/Desktop/onnxruntime/onnxruntime18training/lib
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/home/si/Desktop/onnxruntime/onnxruntime18/lib
#+end_src

- Onnxruntime and onnxruntime-sys are the two dependencies crates, and myonnx are my crate for research purpose.
- Be careful for the target-dir configuration in ./.cargo/config
